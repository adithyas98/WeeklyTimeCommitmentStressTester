<center> <h1> Weekly Time Commitment Stress Tester </h1> </center>

This is kind of an overkill for something that can be simply done through the use of some simple back of the napkin calculations, but I had some time and felt like coding out a Monte Carlo Simulation fort he first time(I have done some on excel spreadsheets but not in python). This is meant to be reused and adapted for various needs and times when you need to make sure you aren't overextending yourself.

## Motivation

As an incoming student at Columbia University, and geek, I have a tendency to be interested in doing and pursuing too many things(My first two years at Colby College is a testament to this), so to prevent this sort of situation from happening again, I wanted to create this simple script where I can input different things I am interested in along with a range of time that I plan on working(which would come in the form of an upper bound. lower bound, and most likely). This would then allow me to use the law of large numbers to get a sense of what type of activities I can take on. However, I must come up with good assumptions since that will be the driving force of the simulation of the semester.(Remember:Garbage in Garbage Out)
